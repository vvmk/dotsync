# dotsync

The intention of this project is to:

* Replace and seriously upgrade the hacky (but hilarious and fun) bash scripts I currently use to 'sync' my dotfiles
* Be a back-end-heavy project to balance out all the front-end code I'm writing lately.
* Require effectively zero effort to sync specific files accross machines/operating systems
